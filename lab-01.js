    Steps: 11.5 points
    Code Format: 10 points
    Github Link: 10 points
  NOTE: The code format and Github link marks are
    only awarded if the steps have been completed.
    (Code formatting is the visual structure of
      you code. I expect that you have used proper
      tabbing of nested structures so code readability
      is adequate.)

/*
  Step 1 (2.5 points):
    Create an array that contains 4 people objects.
    Each object must have at least 2 properties.

  {
    name: "Jack",
    age: "22"
  }

const [{name: my_name, age: my_age}] = arr;

/*
  Step 2 (6 points):
    Create an arrow function that accepts
    a destructured object as an argument. In the
    body of your function, console.log a string
    template utilizing the properties you
    destructured.
*/

/*
  Step 3 (3 points):
    Loop over your array using a for/of loop.
    Call your arrow function passing the array item
    as an argument.
